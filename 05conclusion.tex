% Results/Future work: different domains
% Issues/Motivations: web content (noisy data: value + schema)
% Solutions: Augmented with Knowledge prompts (extra domain knowledge + prompting methods)

In this study, we introduced a framework for addressing entity resolution problems by incorporating external knowledge using prompting techniques. We evaluated our method over a set of datasets from varied domains, and achieved higher performance than state-of-the-art entity resolution method. 
Future study can improve upon our method by introducing more domain-specific knowledge.
