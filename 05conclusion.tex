% Results/Future work: different domains
% Issues/Motivations: web content (noisy data: value + schema)
% Solutions: Augmented with Knowledge prompts (extra domain knowledge + prompting methods)

In this study, we introduced a novel framework, KAER, for entity resolution problems by augmenting PLMS with external knowledge using prompting techniques. 
The framework is evaluated over a set of datasets from varied domains and data types (i.e., dirty, structured, and textual) and improves performance in certain applications over the baseline models. 
Further analysis revealed the effectiveness of different domain knowledge injection and prompting methods on various datasets from different domains and data types.
%, i.e., dirty datasets, structured datasets, and textual datasets. 
%To the most extent, the experimental results verify the importance and necessity of knowledge augmentation for better language understanding on entity resolution tasks. 
The results show a promising direction of injecting knowledge to improve entity resolution performance using PLMs. 
Future studies can improve upon our method by introducing more domain-specific knowledge.
