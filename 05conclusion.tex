% Results/Future work: different domains
% Issues/Motivations: web content (noisy data: value + schema)
% Solutions: Augmented with Knowledge prompts (extra domain knowledge + prompting methods)

In this study, we introduce a novel framework, KAER for entity resolution problems by augmenting PLMS with external knowledge using prompting techniques. We evaluate our method over a set of datasets from varied domains, and achieve competing performance than the baseline models. We further analyze the effectiveness of different domain knowledge injection and prompting methods on various datasets, i.e., dirty datasets, structured datasets, and textual datasets.
%To the most extent, the experimental results verify the importance and necessity of knowledge augmentation for better language understanding on entity resolution tasks. 
Future studies can improve upon our method by introducing more domain-specific knowledge.
