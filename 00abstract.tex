Entity resolution is an important and well-studied task for decades, while it is challenging and expensive to apply the traditional way of matching entities with long sequences of textual data and a large dataset, nor hard to compare the data without recognizing the resourceful semantic data information without domain knowledge. 

In this study, we propose a novel framework for incorporating external knowledge into pre-trained language model for entity resolution. We discussed the results of utilizing different knowledge augmentation and prompting methods to improve entity resolution performance, and we assume a deeper language understanding of the entity resolution problems.

According to our experiment results, our model achieves better results than Ditto, the existing state-of-the-art entity resolution method.
